                    <p>After finishing my graduation it seemed natural for me to continue studying and enroll in a master's degree, but by the end of the first semester I started to feel frustrated. It's very rewarding to grasp the knowledge you get from college, but after a few years it gets discouraging. I wanted more. More experience, more responsibility, more visibility. I felt it was time for me to learn by doing, working side by side with more experienced designers, in a professional environment.</p>

                <p>Mobile web applications are expected to work differently from desktop applications. They need to feel responsive to the user's touch. Having worked on a couple of mobile web applications in the last year, I found that I always start by changing the browser's default appearance and behaviour. This article contains my setup to make a mobile web application feel more like a native one.</p>
